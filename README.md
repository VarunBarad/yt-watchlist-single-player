# YT Watchlist Single Player

It always felt annoying that when I opened a video from my "Watch Later" playlist it would open the whole playlist and add other videos behind the current one on autoplay.

So this extension ensures that when opening a video from your "Watch Later" list it only opens that particular video and not the whole playlist.

## Installation

1. Go to [https://github.com/VarunBarad/yt-watchlist-single-player/releases](https://github.com/VarunBarad/yt-watchlist-single-player/releases)
2. Open the link to `.xpi` file from the latest release
3. Firefox should automatically prompt you about installation
